You've uploaded a file named `Stock_prediction.py`. I can help you create a README file for this Python script. Let me first examine the content of the script to provide an appropriate description.

Based on the content of the `Stock_prediction.py` script, hereâ€™s a simple README file:

# Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using time series forecasting methods. The script is designed to load stock price data, preprocess it, and then apply a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to predict future stock prices.

## Project Structure

- **Importing Libraries:** Essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, pmdarima (for SARIMA modeling), and Matplotlib are imported.
- **Loading Dataset:** The stock price dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - The `Date` column is converted to datetime format.
  - The `Date` column is set as the index of the DataFrame.
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- **Modeling:**
  - The SARIMA model is fitted to the training data using the `auto_arima` function, which automatically determines the best parameters for the model.
- **Prediction:**
  - The model is used to forecast stock prices on the test data.
- **Visualization:**
  - The actual vs. predicted stock prices are plotted using Matplotlib for visual comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- pmdarima
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy pmdarima matplotlib
   ```
3. Place your stock price dataset in the correct path as expected by the script.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Stock_prediction.py
   ```
5. The script will generate a plot showing the actual and predicted stock prices.

## Dataset

The script expects a CSV file containing stock price data with at least a `Date` column and a `Price` column. The `Date` column should be in a recognizable date format.
